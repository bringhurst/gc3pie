Object-oriented interface for computational job control.

A GC3Libs' `Job` is an abstraction of an independent asynchronous
computation, i.e., a GC3Libs' `Job` behaves much like an independent
UNIX process. Indeed, GC3Libs' `Job` objects mimick the POSIX process
interface: `Job`s are started by a parent process, run independently
of it, and need to have their final exit code and output reaped by the
calling process.

The following table makes the correspondence between POSIX processes
and GC3Libs' Job objects explicit.

====================   ================   =====================
`os` module function   GC3Libs function   purpose
====================   ================   =====================
exec                   Gcli.gsub          start new job
kill (SIGTERM)         Gcli.gkill         terminate executing job
wait (WNOHANG)         Gcli.gstat         get job status (running, terminated)
-                      Gcli.gget          retrieve output 

At any given moment, a GC3Libs job is in any one of a set of
pre-defined states, listed in the table below.

GC3Libs' Job state   purpose                                                         can change to
==================   ==============================================================  ======================
NEW                  Job has not yet been submitted/started (i.e., gsub not called)  SUBMITTED (by gsub)
SUBMITTED            Job has been sent to execution resource                         RUNNING, STOPPED
STOPPED              Trap state: job needs manual intervention (either user- \
                     or sysadmin-level) to resume normal execution                   TERMINATED (by gkill), SUBMITTED (by miracle)
RUNNING              Job is executing on remote resource                             TERMINATED
TERMINATED           Job execution is finished (correctly or not) \
                     and will not be resumed                                         None: final state

A job that is not in the NEW or TERMINATED state is said to be a "live" job.

When a Job object is first created, it is assigned the state NEW.
After a successful invocation of `Gcli.gsub()`, the Job object is
transitioned to state SUBMITTED.  Further transitions to RUNNING or
STOPPED or TERMINATED state, happen completely independently of the
creator program.  The `Gcli.gstat()` call provides updates on the
status of a job. (Somewhat like the POSIX `wait(..., WNOHANG)` system
call, except that GC3Libs provide explicit RUNNING and STOPPED states,
instead of encoding them into the return value.)

The STOPPED state is a kind of generic "run time error" state: a job
can get into the STOPPED state if its execution is stopped (e.g., a
SIGSTOP is sent to the remote process) or delayed indefinitely (e.g.,
the remote batch system puts the job "on hold"). There is no way a job
can get out of the STOPPED state automatically: all transitions from the
STOPPED state require manual intervention, either by the submitting
user (e.g., cancel the job), or by the remote systems administrator
(e.g., by releasing the hold).

The TERMINATED state is the final state of a job: once a job reaches
it, it cannot get back to any other state. Jobs reach TERMINATED state
regardless of their exit code, or even if a system failure occurred
during remote execution; actually, jobs can reach the TERMINATED
status even if they didn't run at all! Just like POSIX encodes process
termination information in the "return code", the GC3Libs encode
information about abnormal process termination using a set of
pseudo-signal codes in a job's returncode attribute: i.e., if
termination of a job is due to some gird/batch system/middleware
error, the job's `os.WIFSIGNALED(job.returncode)` will be True and the
signal code (as gotten from `os.WTERMSIG(job.returncode)`) will be one
of the following:

======  ============================================================
signal  error condition
======  ============================================================
125     submission to batch system failed
124     remote error (e.g., execution node crashed, batch system misconfigured)
123     data staging failure
122     job killed by batch system / sysadmin
121     job canceled by user

In addition, each GC3Libs' Job object in TERMINATED state is
guaranteed to have these additional attributes:

    * output_retrieved: boolean flag, indicating whether job output
      has been fetched from the remote resource; use the Gcli.gget()
      function to retrieve the output. (Note: for jobs in TERMINATED
      state, the output can be retrieved only once!)
