GC3Libs - A python package for controlling the life-cycle of a Grid or batch computational job 

GC3Libs provides services for submitting computational jobs to Grids
and batch systems and controlling their execution, persisting job
information, and retrieving the final output.

GC3Libs takes an application-oriented approach to batch computing. A
generic `Application` class provides the basic operations for
controlling remote computations, but different `Application` subclasses
can expose adapted interfaces, focusing on the most relevant aspects
of the application being represented.
