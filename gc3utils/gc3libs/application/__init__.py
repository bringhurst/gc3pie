        Support for running a generic application with the GC3Libs.
        The following parameters are *required* to create an `Application`
        instance:

        * `executable`: name of the application binary to be launched
          on the remote resource; the specifics of how this is handled
          are dependent on the submission backend, but you may always
          run a script that you upload through the `inputs` mechanism
          by specifying './scriptname' as `executable`.

        * `arguments`: list of command-line arguments to pass to
          `executable`; any object in the list will be converted to
          string via Python ``str()``. Note that, in contrast with the
          UNIX ``execvp()`` usage, the first argument in this list
          will be passed as ``argv[1]``, i.e., ``argv[0]`` will always
          be equal to `executable`.

        * `inputs`: list of files that will be copied from the local
          computer to the remote execution node before execution
          starts. Each item in the list should be a pair
          `(local_file_name, remote_file_name)`; specifying a single
          string `file_name` is allowed as a shortcut and will result
          in both `local_file_name` and `remote_file_name` being
          equal.  If an absolute path name is specified as
          `remote_file_name`, then a warning will be issued and the
          behavior is undefined.

        * `outputs`: list of files that will be copied back from the
          remote execution node back to the local computer after
          execution has completed.  Each item in the list should be a pair
          `(remote_file_name, local_file_name)`; specifying a single
          string `file_name` is allowed as a shortcut and will result
          in both `local_file_name` and `remote_file_name` being
          equal.  If an absolute path name is specified as
          `remote_file_name`, then a warning will be issued and the
          behavior is undefined.

        The following optional parameters may be additionally
        specified as keyword arguments and will be given special
        treatment by the `Application` class logic:

        * `requested_cores`, `requested_memory`, `requested_walltime`:
          specify resource requirements for the application: the
          number of independent execution units (CPU cores), amount of
          memory (in GB; will be converted to a whole number by
          truncating any decimal digits), amount of wall-clock time to
          allocate for the computational job (in hours; will be
          converted to a whole number by truncating any decimal
          digits).

        * `environment`: a list of pairs `(name, value)`: the
          environment variable whose name is given by the contents of
          the string `name` will be defined as the content of string
          `value` (i.e., as if "export name=value" was executed prior
          to starting the application).  Alternately, one can pass in
          a list of strings of the form "name=value".

        * `stdin`: file name of a file whose contents will be fed as
          standard input stream to the remote-executing process.

        * `stdout`: name of a file where the standard output stream of
          the remote executing process will be redirected to; will be
          automatically added to `outputs`.

        * `stderr`: name of a file where the standard error stream of
          the remote executing process will be redirected to; will be
          automatically added to `outputs`.

        * `join`: if this evaluates to `True`, then standard error is
          redirected to the file specified by `stdout` and `stderr` is
          ignored.  (`join` has no effect if `stdout` is not given.)

        The ARC submission backend will also make use of the following
        optional parameter:

        * `rtes`: list of run-time environments to request on the
          remote resource; each RTE is specified by a string (its
          name).

        Any other keyword arguments will be set as instance
        attributes, but otherwise ignored by the `Application`
        constructor.

        After successful construction, an `Application` object is
        guaranteed to have at least the following instance attributes:
        * `executable`: a string specifying the executable name
        * `arguments`: list of strings specifying command-line arguments for executable invocation; possibly empty
        * `inputs`: dictionary mapping local file name (a string) to a remote file name (a string)
        * `outputs`: dictionary mapping remote file name (a string) to a local file name (a string)
        * `environment`: dictionary mapping environment variable names to the requested value (string); possibly empty
        * `stdin`: `None` or a string specifying a (local) file name.  If `stdin` is not None, then it matches a key name in `inputs`
        * `stdout`: `None` or a string specifying a (remote) file name.  If `stdout` is not None, then it matches a key name in `outputs`
        * `stderr`: `None` or a string specifying a (remote) file name.  If `stdout` is not None, then it matches a key name in `outputs`
        * `join`: boolean value, indicating whether `stdout` and `stderr` are collected into the same file
        * `rtes`: list of strings specifying the RTEs to request for ARC submission; possibly empty.
