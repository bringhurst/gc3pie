Installation
============

These instructions show how to install the ``grosetta`` script
from the GC3 svn repository into their own python environment.

0. Prerequisites are: ``svn`` (package ``subversion`` in CentOS5 and
   Debian/Ubuntu), the Python development headers and libraries (package
   ``python-devel`` in CentOS5, ``python-dev`` in Debian/Ubuntu).
   These should be available in any decent Linux distribution.


1. If it's not already installed, get the `virtualenv` Python package
   and install it::

      wget http://bitbucket.org/ianb/virtualenv/get/tip.gz#egg=virtualenv-tip
      tar -xzf tip.gz && rm tip.gz 
      cd virtualenv/
 
    If you are installing as `root`, the following command is all you
    need:

      python setup.py install

    If instead you are installing as a normal, unprivileged user,
    things get more complicated:

      export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/lib/python:$PYTHONPATH
      export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
      mkdir -p $HOME/lib/python
      python setup.py install --home $HOME

    (You will also need to add the two `export` lines above to the
    `$HOME/.bashrc` file -if using the `bash` shell- or to the
    `$HOME/.cshrc` file -if using the `tcsh` shell.)

    In any case, once `virtualenv` has been installed, you can exit
    its directory and remove it:
   
      cd ..
      rm -rf virtualenv


2. Create a virtuelnv to host the ``grosetta`` installation::

       virtualenv grosetta
       cd grosetta/
       source bin/activate


3. Create a ``src/`` directory to host the ``grosetta`` and
   check-out the ``gc3utils`` sources there::
     
       mkdir src
       cd src/
       svn co http://gc3pie.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gc3utils
       svn co http://gc3pie.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/grosetta
   
  
4. Install the ``gc3utils`` in "develop" mode, so any modification
   pulled from subversion is immediately reflected in the running environment::

       cd gc3utils/
       env CC=gcc ./setup.py develop 
       cd .. # back into the `src` directory


5. Create a symlink to the ``grosetta`` script in the ``bin/``
   directory::

       cd .. # back into the `grosetta` directory
       ln -s `pwd`/src/grosetta/grosetta.py bin/grosetta


   
Upgrade
=======

These instructions show how to upgrade the ``grosetta`` script to the
latest version found in the GC3 svn repository.

1. `cd` to the directory containing the `grosetta` virtualenv;
   assuming it's named ``grosetta`` as in the above installation
   instructions, you can issue the commands::

     cd grosetta/src

2. Upgrade the `grosetta` source:

     cd grosetta
     svn up
     cd ..

3. Upgrade the `gc3utils` source and run the `setup.py` script again:

     cd gc3utils
     svn up
     env CC=gcc ./setup.py develop
     cd ..
